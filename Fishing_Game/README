2. As the only person in the project, I did all of it
3. This is a fishing game where you must catch five fish using your fishing bobber and avoid the sharks to win the game.
It utilizes the gyroscope and joystick functions of the Raspberry Pie sense hat to control the fishing rod.
4. At the start of the game the player is told to "GO" cast out their fishing rod by tilting the Raspberry pie up then down.
Afterwards, the player controls the red fishing bobber using the joystick, actively trying to avoid the dark gray sharks.
Whilst avoiding being eaten by the sharks, the player must also catch the yellow fish by positioning the bobber on top of
the fish, and tilting the Raspberry Pie upwards to "reel" it in. Another fish will spawn, and the player must keep catching
fish until they catch 5. Once the game is over, either by dying from the shark or catching five fish, the total amount of fish
caught, the "score", will be displayed.
